# Estabelecimento de chave criptogr√°fica utilizando o ganho do canal sem fio como segredo
The growing technological modernization has also brought a concern for information security, since new technologies can generate unprecedented vulnerabilities and, consequently, new types of attacks.

   In this context, it becomes paramount to understand the nature of malicious actions and to utilize communication mechanisms and protocols that ensure the security of transmitted information. Therefore, establishing a secure channel for the exchange of cryptographic keys becomes essential.
	
   This work proposes the establishment of a secure channel using the wireless channel gain as a secret. This novel method does not demand high computational power and is not overly energy-consuming for the devices during the exchange of cryptographic keys. 
   Numerical results and some application scenarios were considered.
